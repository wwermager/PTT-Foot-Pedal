# PTT-Foot-Pedal
This is an ongoing project. I have repurposed an electric keyboard foot pedal (sustain pedal) to be used primarily as a push-to-talk key in VOIP applications. The push-to-talk key is triggered by holding the pedal down for half of a second. There is also currently functionality to bind a key to be pressed in the event the pedal is pressed and released before a half second has elapsed.
